Kenny is an experienced software developer and has been building web applications with various tech stacks. Right now, he has a keen interest in learning React.js, and is currently dabbling with Next.js and Vercel.

When not in office, he enjoys sweating it out. Running, cycling, and football (the English kind), are some of the things he likes. However, with two other little monkeys to take care of, he has been spending less time outdoors.

When the weather's not that great (or rather, when he's just plain lazy), he tries to clear his backlog of games. If only someone would pay him to play games...
