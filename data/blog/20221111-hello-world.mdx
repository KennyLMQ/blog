Hi folks!

I had a bit of time on my hand, and was using it to explore [React](https://reactjs.org), and thinking of what kind of full stack projects I could try my hand on. A few months ago, I discovered [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (yeah, I know I'm late) and it just seemed so straightforward to create an application with it, as things like routing and linting are handled, and you do not have to spend time tinkering with configurations for it.

Also, I found this [Tailwing Blog Template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), which is used to create this blog that you are currently looking at. My hope (if time permits), is to use this to document things I have learnt in my developmental journey, and share my thoughts and experiences. 

It is pretty amazing that hosting your own web application is made so accessible and cheap (sometimes even free) to everyone, so I hope that through my sharing, others can find a way to do it too.

This is it for now. Farewell, and we shall meet again!

## Hello World?

Javascript:

```javascript
const message = 'Hello World!';
console.log(message);
```

C#:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string message = "Hello World!";
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}
```

Python:

```python
message = "Hello World!"
print(message)
```
