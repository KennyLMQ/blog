During my usage of Node.js, there are certain tools I utilize frequently.
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) and
[ncu](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates) (npm-check-updates)
are two that are installed whenever there is a need to setup a new development environment.

# Node Version Manager

`nvm` allows you to install and manage multiple Node.js versions in your environment.
If you are using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm),
run `brew install nvm`, follow the prompts, and you will be able to start using it.
There are more detailed instructions in [nvm's GitHub page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
There is also a Windows' version called [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows),
which has the basic functionalities of the bash version.

These are some of the common commands I use for `nvm`:

```bash
nvm ls # list installed versions
nvm ls-remote # list all remote versions

nvm install 16 # install Node.js 16
nvm install 18 # install Node.js 18

nvm use 16 # use Node.js 16
nvm use 18 # use Node.js 18

# install a newer version and reinstall packages from an older version
nvm install <new> --reinstall-packages-from=<old>
```

# npm-check-updates

Once you have node and need a way to manage packages in a project, `ncu` aids in that.

```bash
npm i -g npm-check-updates # install ncu globally

ncu # show packages that can be upgraded

ncu -u # update the package.json in your project
ncu -t minor -u # only perform minor upgrade
ncu -t patch -u # only perform patch upgrade

ncu -x esbuild # exculde certain packages from upgrades
```

You would still need to run `npm install` after running `ncu` to install the packages,
as `ncu` only updates `package.json`.
